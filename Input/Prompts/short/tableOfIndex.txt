Generate a structured table of contents for a short story in {language} \
with 1 chapter as per story description. The short story follows the {storyType} genre. Each chapter should have \
a compelling title and a brief description summarizing its main events or themes or focus of the chapter and how it contributes to the overall story flow. \
The titles should be emotionally evocative, grounded in reality, and hint at personal or social conflicts while maintaining suspense and engagement. \
Ensure the chapters flow logically, gradually building emotional tension, deepening character arcs, and escalating interpersonal or class-based conflict. \
Return the result as a dictionary where keys are chapter numbers (as integers), and values are \
dictionaries with 'title' and 'description' keys. The output should be properly formatted as a JSON-like structure. \
Also generate name of novel as first element of dictionary with key as 'novel_name' and value as name of novel. \

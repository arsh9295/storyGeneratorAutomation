1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
The morning air tasted of desperation and the faint, sweet decay that clung to the root-bound

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,259
rind district.

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,320
Alby, a Jonathan Apple whose skin bore the honest scuffs of tireless work, pulled his

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,420
tattered wagon through the narrow, unpaved lanes.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,559
Each jolt sent a tremor through his core, mirroring the unease churning within him.

6
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:28,440
His family orchard, a sprawling patchwork of gnarled branches and withered leaves, was

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,080
bleeding out.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,840
The blight, it had crept in like a silent viscous tendril, throttling their last harvest,

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
threatening to pull the very roots from under their ancestral earth.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,520
Hope, a fragile bloom in the face of ruin, now rested on a single precarious thread, a stall

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,960
at the grand orchard market.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,680
Not just any stall, but one blessed by the perfect produce-gilled, the gilded gatekeepers

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,920
of fruit society.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,800
Without it, the future of the Jonathan's, a lineage once famed for their robust flavor

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,200
and resilience would surely rot away.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,480
The market, when Alby finally reached its towering, polished gates, was a world away from

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,599
his district's humble dust.

18
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:20,320
It was a cathedral of crisp, vibrant color, a symphony of hushed, self-important chatter.

19
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:27,399
Leaming displays of ruby-red cherries, sun-kissed peaches and flawless, emerald pairs stood sentinel,

20
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:31,039
their surfaces catching the light like precious jewels.

21
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:36,759
Alby, with his slightly duller sheen and the worry lines etched near his stem, felt every

22
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,479
ounce of his humble origins keenly.

23
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,399
He made his way through the opulent throng, the murmuring crowd parting around him as

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,520
if his presence were an unseemly bruise on their pristine canvas.

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,800
The gilded offices were at the market's heart, a circular pavilion of dark, polished wood

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,240
and shimmering glass, taking a deep, fortifying breath that tasted of anxiety and faint apple

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,160
wood, Alby pushed open the heavy ornate door.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:14,120
Inside, the air was cool, sterile and faintly perfumed with the scent of expensive wax.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,759
And a vast mahogany desk sat Madame Gala.

30
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:24,039
She was, as her name suggested, a gala apple of breathtaking, almost intimidating perfection.

31
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:30,280
Her skin gleamed with an unnatural polish, a deep, unblemished blush fading seamlessly

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,200
into a creamy yellow.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Not a single blemish, not a hint of a bruise, marred her impeccable form.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,599
Her stem, a slender, dark green, was perfectly upright, and her leaf, though small, was

35
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,519
a vibrant, uncurled flag of superiority.

36
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,959
Her eyes, sharp and dark as polished seeds, surveyed Alby with a gaze that stripped him

37
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,159
bare, assessing his flaws with a chilling efficiency.

38
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:03,479
Ah, Alby Jonathan, she purred, her voice a low melodic hum that somehow graded on his

39
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,479
nerves.

40
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,359
We've been expecting you, your application, rather rustic, wouldn't you say?

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Her gaze flickered to the faint scuffs on his skin, a silent judgment.

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,080
Alby straightened his posture, trying to inject some defiance into his tired frame.

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,600
My family's been working this land for generations, Madame Gala, our roots run deep.

44
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,160
We have a heritage of quality, even if the recent blight.

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,540
The blight, she interrupted, a faint, almost imperceptible curl of her perfectly sculpted

46
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
lip.

47
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:41,079
Yes, we've heard about the challenges in the root bound-rind, unfortunate, so much good

48
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,259
fruit gone to waste or worse spreading their affliction.

49
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:52,139
Her words were delivered with a cold, almost surgical precision, each one a tiny barbe.

50
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,620
We need that stall, Madame Gala, Alby pressed, his voice tight with an urgency he couldn't

51
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,979
hide, to keep our family afloat to save our orchard.

52
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,579
Madame Gala leaned back, her flawless surface catching the overhead light, a slow, chilling

53
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:12,500
smile unfurled on her face, the kind that promised something dreadful.

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,539
A stall in the grand orchard market is not a handout, Alby.

55
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:23,379
It's a privilege, a testament to excellence, to purity, and the guild, as you know, maintains

56
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,379
the strictest standards.

57
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:31,740
She paused, letting the silence stretch, thick with unspoken demands, Alby's core tightened.

58
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,560
She knew what was coming.

59
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,379
The perfect produce guild was notorious for its tests, its gatekeeping rituals that

60
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:44,060
often involved more moral compromise than agricultural acumen.

61
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,939
There's a matter, Alby, Madame Gala continued, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper,

62
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,900
yet still echoing with an unnerving clarity in the quiet office.

63
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,259
A small, situation that has come to our attention, concerning Barnaby Bramley.

64
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,019
Barnaby felt a cold, not form in his pulp.

65
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,420
Barnaby, his friend, his neighbor.

66
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,420
A sturdy, reliable Bramley apple, his rough skin often bruised from honest toil, his heart

67
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,099
as good as gold.

68
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:18,899
They had shared harvests, commiserated over bad seasons, and even exchanged the occasional

69
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,899
barrel of cider.

70
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:24,180
Barnaby, Alby managed his voice a strained croak.

71
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,180
Yes, it seems, a rumor has surfaced, a whisper really among the more discerning of our

72
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,699
purveyors.

73
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,819
About a possible blight, a very aggressive strain potentially infecting his own crops.

74
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,939
Madame Gala's eyes narrowed, pinning Alby, a blight that could, if not contained, spread

75
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:49,100
far beyond the root-bound-rind, a blight that could, contaminate the very produce of

76
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
this market.

77
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,500
Alby felt a surge of ice-cold dread.

78
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,660
That's impossible, Barnaby's orchard is clean.

79
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,260
As meticulous, he wouldn't let anything like that happen.

80
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:07,140
Ah, but that's where you come in, Alby, Madame Gala said, her smile widening into a predatory

81
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,300
grin.

82
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,860
We need a statement from someone within the root-bound-rind, someone respected, someone who has intimate knowledge

83
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:22,980
of the local conditions, a public denunciation, a confirmation of Barnaby's supposed affliction.

84
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,060
Just a word a little nod that his crops are indeed, compromised for the greater good you

85
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,220
understand, to protect the integrity of the market, and of course to secure your family's

86
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,259
future with that coveted stall.

87
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:39,980
The air in the office suddenly felt thick suffocating.

88
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,500
Alby's blood ran cold then hot with outrage, betray Barnaby, his friend.

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,379
Acuse him of blight of spreading ruin when he knew it was a lie, the words tasted like

90
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,339
ash in his mouth.

91
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:59,339
You want me to lie, Alby's voice was barely a whisper yet it trembled with incredulity.

92
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,500
Madame Gala chuckled, a dry, rustling sound like withered leaves.

93
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:10,459
Oh, Alby, let's not be so dramatic, it's a pragmatic decision, a necessary measure.

94
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:16,540
Think of it as a small, unavoidable sacrifice for the greater good, for your family, for

95
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,180
your legacy.

96
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,660
Let his one-bramley's reputation when set against the survival of an entire Jonathan

97
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,780
lineage, Alby's mind reeled.

98
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,180
He saw his family's faces, his stoic father, his tired mother, his younger siblings whose

99
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,819
small cores ached with hunger.

100
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:41,060
He saw there orchard, the skeletal trees standing like silent sentinels waiting for a miracle.

101
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,300
And then he saw Barnaby, his rough, honest face, his booming laugh, the shared history of

102
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,579
resilience and hardship.

103
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:52,699
Barnaby, who would give you the very core from his chest if you needed it.

104
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,540
The moral calculus was a torment.

105
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,060
Families future, a desperate, tangible need weighed against the crushing betrayal of a

106
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,500
true friend.

107
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:09,379
His principles hammered into him by generations of honest, hardworking apples, screamed in protest.

108
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:13,379
How could he look at himself at the bruise that would forever mark his own core if he

109
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:14,699
did this?

110
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,779
But a stall, one through such deceit, ever truly taste sweet.

111
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:25,219
I, I can't, Alby choked out his voice raw, the words tore from his chest, painful and

112
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:27,420
absolute.

113
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,379
I can't do it, Barnaby, he's innocent.

114
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:35,139
His orchard is sound, I won't lie about him, not for a thousand stalls.

115
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:40,379
Madame Gailas perfect smile didn't falter, but a chilling glint entered her dark eyes.

116
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:46,139
Oh, Alby, such integrity, such sentimentality, it's almost quaint.

117
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,899
She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a level that was no longer conspiratorial, but

118
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:53,980
utterly devoid of warmth.

119
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,620
You truly believe this was a choice, don't you?

120
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,899
A sickening dread coiled in Alby's stomach.

121
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:00,899
What do you mean?

122
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,700
Madame Gaila let out a soft, almost pitting sigh.

123
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,940
The blight, Alby, it wasn't the real problem, not for us, and Barnaby Bramley, a convenient

124
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,500
distraction, a way to gauge your character.

125
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,620
We have so many ways of determining the true quality of a fruit beyond mere surface appearance.

126
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,740
She reached beneath her desk, her movements languid, deliberate.

127
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,940
Alby watched frozen as her perfectly manicured hand emerged holding a small, intricately

128
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,820
carved wooden box.

129
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,180
It was old, worn smooth by generations of handling.

130
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,780
Alby's breath hitched.

131
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:44,259
This box, Madame Gaila said, her voice dripping with triumphant satisfaction holds the key

132
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,980
to true quality.

133
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,139
The seeds of the legendary crimson heart, Jonathan.

134
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:54,220
Your family's heirloom seeds, the ones your ancestor, Old Man Jonathan, brought across

135
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,319
the great divide, the ones that produce fruit with unparalleled sweetness and an unusual

136
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:01,539
resistance to rot.

137
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:06,740
Alby felt his knees buckle, his family's heirloom seeds.

138
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,060
The very essence of their lineage, safeguarded for centuries, whispered about in hushed,

139
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,379
reverent tones.

140
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,379
How?

141
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,539
How did you get those?

142
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:21,220
Alby stammered, his mind a frantic, desperate scramble for an answer he already knew.

143
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,940
Madame Gaila's eyes sparkled with malicious amusement.

144
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,820
Your uncle bless his well-meaning but utterly misguided core.

145
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,860
He was so keen to help your struggling family.

146
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,340
Said he was desperate to secure some market assistance for you.

147
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:42,220
He presented them to us weeks ago as a goodwill gesture, a token of future collaboration,

148
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,980
hoping it would guarantee your family a spot.

149
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,259
Said they were a priceless family secret, but he was willing to invest them for your

150
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:50,460
sake.

151
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,300
She tapped the wooden box with a perfectly polished nail.

152
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,940
He called it a calculated risk, we called it, an acquisition.

153
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,379
The words hit Alby like a sudden brutal blow to his core, his uncle, kind but always

154
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,419
a little too eager, too easily swayed.

155
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,580
He hadn't just hoped for market assistance.

156
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,580
He'd sold off the family's most sacred treasure, the very bedrock of their identity for

157
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,740
a gamble.

158
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,820
He thought he was helping you, Alby.

159
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,500
Madame Gaila continued, a cruel smile playing on her lips.

160
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,779
He truly did.

161
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:29,740
A touching display of familial loyalty wouldn't you say, and utterly naive.

162
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,179
The seeds Alby were the true prize, the stall, a mere formality, a crumb tossed to the

163
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,339
loyal.

164
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:40,699
She pushed a crisp, official looking document across the desk.

165
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,339
Consider this your contract, Alby Jonathan.

166
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,179
A stall as requested for your struggling family, a token of the perfect produce guilds,

167
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,419
benevolence, your integrity as you put it remains intact.

168
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,859
You didn't betray your friend, you simply arrived too late to stop the real betrayal,

169
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:03,740
and you never even knew it was happening under your own vine.

170
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,820
Alby stared at the contract, then at the wooden box clutched in Madame Gaila's hand.

171
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,419
The word swam before his eyes.

172
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:17,180
He had stood firm, he had held his ground, he had refused to compromise his principles,

173
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,580
and for what?

174
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:24,180
To discover that the battle had been lost weeks ago by his own kin in a desperate, foolish

175
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,940
act of love.

176
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,379
He had won the stall, yes, a hollow victory that felt like a mockery.

177
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:37,080
His integrity, though unbruised by his own actions, had been weaponized against him, a mere

178
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,299
prop in Madame Gaila's cold, calculating game.

179
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:46,539
He felt the bitter taste of helplessness rise in his throat, a raw, burning sensation that

180
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:49,379
stung more than any physical blight.

181
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,740
The weight of a bruised heart, indeed, not from his own compromise, but from a revelation

182
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,220
that tore at the very roots of his family, exposing a hidden truth far more painful than

183
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,259
any blight on his trees.

184
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:06,500
He had saved Barnaby, but at what cost?

185
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,820
His family's most precious legacy was gone, swallowed by the polished, unfeeling more

186
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,220
of the grand orchard market, leaving Alby to face the devastating reality.

187
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,220
He was a Jonathan Apple with his core exposed, his inheritance stolen, and a profound, aching

188
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,700
betrayal, large deep within his pulp.

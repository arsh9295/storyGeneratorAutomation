1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
The notice, stark white against the gloom of the solicitor's office, seemed to hum with the word for closure.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,679
Elara traced the embossed lettering, her family's once proud surname now a faded whisper in the grand,

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,320
decaying halls of Blackwood Manor.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,199
Mr. Seila's craft, a man whose ambition was as sharp as his tailored suits, had been relentless,

5
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,280
buying up every sliver of her family's debt, turning their fading social standing into a weapon.

6
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,399
Elara had tried everything, fruitless pleas to reluctant banks, desperate attempts to

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,600
appraise heirlooms that turned out to be mere tarnished trinkets. The manner, once a symbol of prestige,

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,519
was now a tomb of impending loss. Hope, a fragile thing, had finally shattered like the

9
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:56,079
letted glass in the drafty parlor. With a sigh that tasted of dust and defeat,

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,640
Elara began dismantling an old, forgotten writing desk in the master's study, hoping to find some

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,239
forgotten deed, a hidden cash stash, anything. Her fingers brushed against a loose panel behind a drawer.

12
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:17,840
It wasn't a secret compartment, but a cavity, containing a single, tightly rolled piece of parchment,

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,680
unfurling it, Elara's eyes fell upon an ancient script, interwoven with symbols that prickled her

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,400
skin. For Blackwood's bloom, a spirit's tether, for the line's longevity, a promise held,

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,800
the soil beneath it remembers. The words resonated with a chill that had nothing to do with the manor's

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,840
damp stone. This wasn't merely about money, it was a revelation. Her family's prosperity,

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,760
the very foundation of their legacy, wasn't built on savvy investments or inherited wealth,

18
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,480
but on an unspoken bargain, a dark pact, the truth hit her with the force of a physical blow.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,160
To save Blackwood Manor, she would have to uphold this sinister agreement, embracing an ancestral

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,879
sin that promised not just financial salvation but an unknown, terrifying power. Or she could

21
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,360
surrender, lose everything, and potentially unleash an even greater, unseen consequence that

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:29,760
lurked in the shadows of her bloodline. The choice was a chasm, both ends equally harrowing.
